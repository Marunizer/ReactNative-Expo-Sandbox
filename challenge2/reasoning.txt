}

type: to identify notifcation time of where to navigate


id: id for notification message.


content[] : holds the fields we care about for actually rendering the notification.


title: the simple main label for the notification. Could be an action, an account username, or 
        examples:
             " {username} has just subscribed!" , "{username}" shared this thread... 
             "{username} commented on ...", "{username subscribed to} has made a new note/thread"

             simpler: "New Subscriber", "{username}" in this case, the username is enough, and the action text could be in the body


body: usually a sneak peak at the content written, or an action performed if the title is simple. 
        on a comment , it will show the text from the comment.
        - also can stuff text for a showToast here


icon: could be either a string identifying if you want to display an icon representing a new message/comment/etc..
      could also refer to a url to grab the icon picture from a user that made an action notifying your account


sound: a little extra, if we want different sounds for different notifications this could be useful,
       I would assume the audio files for the sounds would be packaged with the app but if instead they were in the cloud, a user 
       could get the updated notification sound without updating the app.


route: where to navigate the apps View or Screen to. This really will jsut be the entity id of the account it belongs to.

route_data: for cases such as sharing a specific card in a thread
            if users can have up to 36 cards or more on a thread, 
            sharing a specific card may defz be wanted so user is 
            not expected to swipe through them all
            
            -will control the thread / collection / note wanted to navigate to by storing an id of the Object.


createdAt: stole this from the example given, generally a good idea to keep track of metadata like this, but also important information
           for the user to know WHEN the notification took place.


causer[]: from the "Things to consider" section. I did not include information for a user that could be responsible for a notification.
        It seems like information related to the user that the app cares to display would already be displayed in title/body/icon. 
        However, in the case where we have a feed of notifications, it would be good to include data from the 'causer' like a route
        to their account so they can just tap the name of the 'causer' and be routed towards their profile page.

        would be something like:
                                 causer {
                                            username: string
                                            Id: string,
                                            route: string,
                                            profileImageUrl: string(url),
                                        }
