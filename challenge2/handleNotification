 Have not really done anything here yet, just kinda thinking about it.

  Not sure what the goal for this function is suppose to be:  handles your newly designed notification structure for frontend navigation.
  - if I am expected to parse the JSON notification here?
  - if I need to manage the pages, go back to home, then route to a collection, then to a thread, then to etc... 
        but if the views shown on screen are based on a push, pop (onBack) then this doesn't seem like the case
  - I may need a little more clarity on what the notification/message types are intended to be
  
  My current assumptions: 

       - the notifications are what you would see from like a twitter app when someone likes/retweets a post.

       - the notification object is a model of a JSON notification that's alrady been parsed.


        - push(location, locationInfo) 
            -> locationInfo  was left vague and I don't know it's intention. 
                I'm going by an assumption that 'locationinfo' is not a necessary parameter
                like push(location, locationInfo?) for default scenarios where the owner has not
                updated application but would still want a standard route to the view without more features.

        - goBack() 
            -> I'm not sure why I would need access to this, if the purpose of
